# heart-disease-prediction
## Goal
Prediction of heart disease using various Machine Learning algorithms
## Prerequisite
The following softwares and libraries are required in order to run this project:
* Python 3.6 (https://www.python.org/download)
* Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
* Jupyter Notebook (Run command 'python3 -m pip install jupyter' in command prompt)
* Scikit-learn (Run command 'pip install sklearn' in command prompt)
* Pandas (Run command 'pip install pandas' in command prompt)
* Numpy (Run command 'pip install numpy' in command prompt)
* Matplotlib (Run command 'python -m pip install -U matplotlib' in command prompt)
* Seaborn (Run command 'pip install seaborn' in command prompt)
## Dataset
The dataset used in this repository is taken from Kaggle. It contains the following columns:
* age: The person's age in years
* sex: The person's sex 
     * 1 = male
     * 0 = female
* cp: The chest pain experienced 
     * Value 1: typical angina
     * Value 2: atypical angina
     * Value 3: non-anginal pain
     * Value 4: asymptomatic
* trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
* chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl
* fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl)
     * 1 = true
     * 0 = false
* restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement 
     * 0 = normal
     * 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality
     * 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
* thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved
* exang: Exercise induced angina 
     * 1 = yes
     * 0 = no
* oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)
* slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 
     * Value 1: upsloping
     * Value 2: flat
     * Value 3: downsloping
* ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)
* thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)
* target: Heart disease 
     * 0 = no
     * 1 = yes
